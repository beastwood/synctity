Synctity Documentation
======================

Synctity is a graphical program for synchronizing remote and local file systems.  This program can be used to create backups, enable working from multiple computers without worrying about which files are current, publish content to a website, or copy files from one computer to another.

Synctity is a front end for :command:`rsync`, so users who are familiar with that program will recognize immediately how it works.  However, Synctity is designed so that knowledge of rsync is not necessary.
